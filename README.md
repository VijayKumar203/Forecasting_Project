# Financial Forecasting_Project
This repository contains code for forecasting exchange rates using a neural network model. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The results include various statistical indices and visualizations to assess model performance.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to forecast the exchange rate using historical data. The dataset used is EURUSDX.csv which contains exchange rate data. The model is built using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.

# Results 
The results include:
